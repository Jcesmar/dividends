v0.b:
* Created python file that performs the same operation. In order to execute it, introduce the ticker as an input argument in the execution line.
* Included the tickers from IBEX-35 available during 2019.

v0.a:
* Initial and incomplete version of the code.
* There are several tickers that need to be added.
* A function needs to be created so the function accepts a ticker as an input argument and it gives back a string with the dividend info.
